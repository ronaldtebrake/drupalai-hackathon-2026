# Punctuation

## Avoid Overuse of Punctuation

If you need to break up your text with commas, dashes or brackets, it is often a sign that your sentences are too long and complicated. Rather than splitting up the blocks of meaning with punctuation, split your sentences to a maximum of about 25 words with one idea per sentence.

## Brackets (Parentheses)

**Round brackets** can be used to explain the preceding item in the text, but use them only if truly necessary.

**Square brackets** can be used to make insertions in quoted material, e.g.: "The ETS [Emissions Trading System] needs to be reformed", says Commissioner XY.

## Dashes and Hyphens

Beware of using too many dashes. 1 dash or a set of paired dashes per paragraph is enough.

**Hyphens (-)** are used to join pairs: the Brussels-Paris route, the height-depth ratio, etc.

**Short dashes (En dashes, – )** may be used to punctuate a sentence instead of commas or round brackets. They are always preceded and followed by spaces.

**Long dashes (Em dashes, — )** are no longer used.

## Exclamation Marks

Use only for very serious warnings.

## Quotation Marks and Apostrophes

Use **single quotation marks** to signal direct speech and quotes, and to flag a word as jargon, while explaining what it actually means: The 'subsidiarity' principle, whereby decisions are taken at a level of authority as close to citizens as possible.

Use **double quotation marks** for quotations within quotes.

## Spaces

- Colons, semi-colons and slashes are always joined up to the preceding word
- Stops (. ? ! : , ; ) are always followed by a single space, not a double space
