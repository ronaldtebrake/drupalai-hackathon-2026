  # Jargon and Clear Writing Alternatives

  ## Plain Language Alternatives

  The main problem for anybody working in the EU environment is realising what counts as jargon. This includes staff in the institutions and writers in the private sector who tend to reuse the jargon from the EU source texts.

  Working in the EU environment can make you jargon-blind. You might recognise e.g. 'subsidiarity' or 'countervailing duties' as technical jargon - but EU language is full of many less obvious jargon terms, influenced especially by legal/diplomatic terminology. For example, when did you last negotiate your accession to a gym or sports club, or go on holiday to a third country?

  Additionally, in English - the original language of most web texts - there is the extra problem of false friends, mostly from French.

  Find plain language alternatives to common EU jargon in our A-Z table of jargon and false friends below.

  If there is no plain language alternative, then explain the jargon or technical term the first time you use it on the page.

  ## A to Z – Jargon and False Friends

  As a general principle **use plain English** when writing for the European Commission website. The following list provides alternatives for:

  ### Unclear Names for EU-Related Concepts

  **A**

Aquaculture unexplained may be acceptable in specialist texts, though it cannot hurt to be explicit about what it covers. In texts for the general public, definitely add an explanation. Even if fish farming doesn't accurately describe the whole sector, it represents a large percentage of it, so this loose label might be permissible for communication purposes in some contexts.

  ## Important Notes

  Often, the 'EU aspect' of terms related to the Commission's activities is implicit. But needs to be made explicit for non‑expert audiences: acquis vs. body of EU law.

  We've not included here the numerous Latin expressions that regularly turn up in Commission texts. Avoid them where at all possible.

  But one person's jargon is another person's ordinary professional language. So **use the words your target audience does**.
