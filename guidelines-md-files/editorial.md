# Dates, Numbers and Symbols

## Dates

- Write the day as a number and the month in letters - e.g. 12 May
- Use all 4 digits for the year - e.g. 2020 (not '20)
- Don't use commas - e.g. 14 July 1999 (not 14 July, 1999)
- Don't use 'the' before the date. Don't use letters (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th)
- **Example:** on 9 October 2019 (not "on the 9th of October 2019")

## Date Ranges

Separate dates with either prepositions or dashes but don't mix them.

- from 1990 to 1995, **not** from 1990- 95
- between 1990 and 1995, **not** between 1990 - 95
- the 2007-08 report is available online

For date ranges where you indicate the year only, use a short dash with no spaces.

- 1996 - 2006

If the years are in the same century, don't repeat the century.

- 1939- 45

For date ranges where you indicate more than just the year, use a short dash with a space on either side of the dash.

- 2 - 5 March 2014
- 25 December 2011 - 30 January 2012

## Time

- Use the 24 hour clock
- Include the time zone (only once per date range)
- Separate hours and minutes with a colon
  - 09:00 (CET)
  - 23:59 (EST)
  - 17 March 2019, 09:00 - 18 March 2019, 18:00 (CET)

## Numbers

In most cases don't write numbers out, use numerals (1, 2, 3) which are easier to read onscreen.

However, avoid 2 numerals next to each other: 8 one‑day sessions, not 8 1-day sessions.

## Decimals

In English, Irish and Maltese, a point is used to separate whole numbers from decimals:

- 9.7 billion people
- 2.3 million light years

A comma is used for the same purpose in all other languages and in multilingual texts:

- 9,7 milliards
- 2,3 millions d'années lumière

## Thousands

A 'non-breaking' space is used to indicate thousands in whole numbers (not a comma). Decimals are grouped in a single block:

- 152 231.324567

## Fractions

Avoid using fractions. Decimals are easier to read and understand onscreen.

- Duration of visit: 2.5 hours (NOT 2½ hours)

## Numbers Greater Than 1 Million

For readability, use the words million, billion and trillion rather than a series of 000's:

- The Commission has committed €2.5 billion to the initiative
- The world economy has grown 470.1 trillion % since 2001

Billion means a thousand million (not a million million). Trillion means a million million.

In general do not abbreviate million and billion. However to avoid excessive repetition (for example in tables) they can be abbreviated to 'm' and 'bn' respectively. Use a space after the digits.

**Example table:**

| Country | Deficit (€) |
|---------|-------------|
| Country A | 10 m |
| Country B | 15 bn |

## Recommendations for Rounding Large Numbers

- If we don't need the highest level of accuracy, we can use rounding e.g. €60 million dedicated to language training for migrants, not €60,250,005 dedicated…
- Use only the number of digits that are necessary and make sense for clear communication
- A disclaimer should be added, when applicable, at the beginning or end of the publication describing the rounding policy and the reasons for possible inconsistencies - e.g. Figures have been rounded to one decimal place for the sake of brevity

## Telephone Numbers

Write the full number including the international code. Use + instead of 00. Separate the regional prefix from the main number.

If the number does not send the caller to a specific department within the European Commission, add Commission switchboard in brackets.

**Example:**

+32 2 299 11 11 (Commission switchboard)

## Symbols

Do not use spaces between symbols and figures.

Avoid using the ampersand (&) - use 'and' instead.

Use the following symbols:

- Currency symbols: €150 (EUR, GBP can also be used but the symbol is better)
- Percentage: 5%
- Temperature: 37°C

Do not use a space between the numbers and the symbol.

# Formatting

## Headings

- Use a maximum of 3 levels of nested headings (heading 2, heading 3, heading 4 - note: the page title is equivalent to heading 1)
- Help users and search engines scan your page by following the hierarchical order of headings: <h1> headings should be used for main headings, followed by <h2> headings, then the less important <h3>, and so on
- Write clear headings which let the user know what they'll find in the following section so they know if that's what they're looking for
- Headings should be a maximum 60 characters including spaces - because search engines cut off longer titles when displaying search results
- Do not use colons at the end of headings
- Break up blocks of text with sub-headings to help users scan your content
- Use subheadings every 2-4 paragraphs

## Paragraphs

- Try to vary paragraph lengths, so readers can tell them apart and find their way as the page scrolls down
- Short is good. Even one sentence. Aim for no more than 3 or 4 sentences
- Each paragraph should have just 1 main idea

## Bold Type

Use bold text very sparingly, and only to emphasise key ideas in each paragraph. Never use bold type merely to make your text look better (such as in captions, names etc.). Limit bolding to just the relevant words, not whole phrases, sentences or paragraphs.

## Italics

Avoid using italics, because italicised text is difficult for vision-impaired users to read on low‑resolution displays.

## Underline

Don't underline anything but links. On webpages most people assume that anything that is underlined is a link no matter what colour it is.

## Bullet Points

Bulleted lists help users to scan. If you have 3 or more items listed in running text, consider putting them in a bulleted list. Remember, however, that having too many bullets in the same list looks odd.

Use the bulleted list format in the rich text editor in the CMS (as opposed to manually adding numbers/asterisks to a list of items). This is necessary for text-to-speech software.

For ease of reading, we generally:

- Don't use a colon before the list
- Limit the text by each bullet point
- Do not capitalise the first letter of each point
- Do not use punctuation such as commas, full stops or semicolons at the end of each point

However, if your bullet point is composed of more than 1 complete sentence, punctuation becomes necessary. Also, a final point is recommended for a bulleted list that is part of a sentence.

## Numbering

Numbering should be preferred to the bulleted list only when there is an order to the list. The punctuation rules are the same as for bullet points, there should only be a final full-point if the list is part of a sentence and no other punctuation.

# Jargon and Clear Writing Alternatives

## Plain Language Alternatives

The main problem for anybody working in the EU environment is realising what counts as jargon. This includes staff in the institutions and writers in the private sector who tend to reuse the jargon from the EU source texts.

Working in the EU environment can make you jargon-blind. You might recognise e.g. 'subsidiarity' or 'countervailing duties' as technical jargon - but EU language is full of many less obvious jargon terms, influenced especially by legal/diplomatic terminology. For example, when did you last negotiate your accession to a gym or sports club, or go on holiday to a third country?

Additionally, in English - the original language of most web texts - there is the extra problem of false friends, mostly from French.

Find plain language alternatives to common EU jargon in our A-Z table of jargon and false friends below.

If there is no plain language alternative, then explain the jargon or technical term the first time you use it on the page.

## A to Z – Jargon and False Friends

As a general principle **use plain English** when writing for the European Commission website. The following list provides alternatives for:

### Unclear Names for EU-Related Concepts

**A**

Aquaculture unexplained may be acceptable in specialist texts, though it cannot hurt to be explicit about what it covers. In texts for the general public, definitely add an explanation. Even if fish farming doesn't accurately describe the whole sector, it represents a large percentage of it, so this loose label might be permissible for communication purposes in some contexts.

## Important Notes

Often, the 'EU aspect' of terms related to the Commission's activities is implicit. But needs to be made explicit for non‑expert audiences: acquis vs. body of EU law.

We've not included here the numerous Latin expressions that regularly turn up in Commission texts. Avoid them where at all possible.

But one person's jargon is another person's ordinary professional language. So **use the words your target audience does**.

# Linking

## What Are Links

Websites interconnect via the web through (hyper)links. Links can be:

- **Internal** to the website or domain, to the pages and documents constituting the website or the websites within the domain
- **External** to websites outside the europa.eu domain and out of control of the owner of the website containing the link

## When to Use Links

Use links to help users get the information they came for. Link to:

- Where your users might need to go next
- High-quality, closely related content
- Content that explains key words and concepts that are difficult or complex

Please note: while studies show that links in a text may distract users from the information and would read better at the end of a paragraph, links embedded in a paragraph send useful, additional contextual information to search engine crawlers. Please bear this in mind and balance usability and search engine optimisation (SEO) when adding links to your text.

Don't link to pages just to provide general background information that might be of interest. Users should be confident that all our links are truly valuable.

For that reason, don't use 'Useful links' as a heading. Why would we give users any other type of links? Choose a heading that tells the reader **why** the links are useful:

- other organisations dealing with …
- legislative documents
- studies on …

## How to Write Meaningful Link Labels

Link labels should tell the user where they will end up when they click on them. Use keywords or the title of the page you're linking to, as long as it describes the content clearly. It is always better to:

- Keep them short, so they're easy to scan both for people and for machines such as refreshable Braille displays
- Remember that machine readers usually read every word in a link label, they can't skim over them
- Accurately describe what the user will find at the link destination

But:

- Don't use generic labels such as click here, here, more or read more
- Don't use URLs (http://…), even when shortened
- Don't make an article number of a legal document part of the link unless you are anchor-linking to the article

It's okay if your link label doesn't exactly match the title of the page you're linking to – especially if the label is nice and short – as long as it describes the content clearly.

**Instead of:** Overview of EU's relations with China

**Write:** EU-China relations

**Instead of:** European Union report to the UNCCD of the policies, financial instruments and projects that have contributed and are currently supporting sustainable drylands management activities in Africa over the period January 2000-December 2003

**Write:** Report: EU support for sustainable drylands management in Africa (2000-03)

**Instead of:** Regulation (EC) No 689/2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 March 2007 establishing and amending the rules on data protection

**Write:** EU regulation 689/2007 on data protection

**Instead of:** This is covered by article 99 of the Financial Regulation. (unless you are actually linking directly to the article)

**Write:** This is covered by article 99 of the Financial Regulation.

## Internal Links

When adding internal links, avoid automatically opening a new window or tab. It can be confusing for some people, such as those using assistive technology.

The W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI), which develops standards to help understand and implement accessibility, states:

"In general, it is better not to open new windows and tabs since they can be disorienting for people, especially people who have difficulty perceiving visual content."

Sometimes it is acceptable to open a link in a new tab or window, if opening on the same page would interrupt a process. For example, if the user is:

- Filling out a form
- Consenting to cookies but wants to read the privacy statement
- Requesting a translation but wants to read the disclaimer

Automatically opening the link in the same tab or window in these situations might cause the user to lose their input or have to start over. In such cases, it is good practice to give users advanced warning of the change of context (for example, by adding the label "opens in new window").

## External Links

When publishing an external link on a page owned by a European Commission service, the linked website is considered as a third party. This has implications in at least two areas:

### Content

As stated in the corporate legal notice, Commission services have no control over the content of linked third-party websites, so the Commission can assume no responsibility for the running/functioning of the external sites or for any pages they link to.

Nevertheless, the fact that the Commission links to third-party content can be seen as an endorsement of a third-party service, content or policies.

### Data Protection

The European Commission is subject to specific legal obligations concerning the protection and processing of personal data, described in Regulation (EU) 2018/1725. The Commission must comply with these obligations in all operations involving personal data, including processing via Commission websites.

While organisations and websites must in general respect the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/67, the Commission cannot ensure that data processing on the linked external websites follows the mandatory data protection principles.

Therefore, the Commission cannot ensure that the privacy of website users who follow external links is not put at risk, especially if data processing on the linked third-party websites is not compatible with the processing by EUIs, e.g. when third-party websites track users across websites for advertising and profiling purposes.

### Rule

Link to external pages only if they provide high-quality content that is different from the information on your page but relevant to it.

It is important to ensure that external websites linked to from official Commission websites are accurate, relevant and appropriate.

**Please note: it is also important to check external links from your content at least once a quarter as URLs change and you may find your content linking to a site that is completely inappropriate.**

The European Commission is not legally responsible for the content of the sites to which you link, but their quality, content and tone should not reflect badly on the Commission.

### External Links Evaluation Criteria

Before publishing an external link, site owners must evaluate the accuracy, relevance, and appropriateness of all external links in a consistent way. External sites must meet the following criteria:

- The external website is **relevant** and **useful** to visitors to the specific Commission website where the link is published
- The external website deals with an issue, policy or outside organisation **in greater depth** than is appropriate on Europa
- The content on the external website is **not available elsewhere** on an official Commission website
- The external website is **authoritative, accurate** and **up-to-date**
- The external website is **representative** - if your page covers a range of countries, organisations or languages, then your links should too
- The relevant content on the external website is **freely available** and no registration or payment is required to access it
- The external website **does not contain abusive or discriminatory content**, or infringe any third party rights, including third parties' intellectual property rights

Site owners must monitor the relevance, timeliness and availability of any published external links, and remove any such links that are no longer relevant to visitors to Commission websites.

If in doubt, do not link. The Web Communication Unit (COMM A2) reserves the right to disallow or remove any such links.

# Punctuation

## Avoid Overuse of Punctuation

If you need to break up your text with commas, dashes or brackets, it is often a sign that your sentences are too long and complicated. Rather than splitting up the blocks of meaning with punctuation, split your sentences to a maximum of about 25 words with one idea per sentence.

## Brackets (Parentheses)

**Round brackets** can be used to explain the preceding item in the text, but use them only if truly necessary.

**Square brackets** can be used to make insertions in quoted material, e.g.: "The ETS [Emissions Trading System] needs to be reformed", says Commissioner XY.

## Dashes and Hyphens

Beware of using too many dashes. 1 dash or a set of paired dashes per paragraph is enough.

**Hyphens (-)** are used to join pairs: the Brussels-Paris route, the height-depth ratio, etc.

**Short dashes (En dashes, – )** may be used to punctuate a sentence instead of commas or round brackets. They are always preceded and followed by spaces.

**Long dashes (Em dashes, — )** are no longer used.

## Exclamation Marks

Use only for very serious warnings.

## Quotation Marks and Apostrophes

Use **single quotation marks** to signal direct speech and quotes, and to flag a word as jargon, while explaining what it actually means: The 'subsidiarity' principle, whereby decisions are taken at a level of authority as close to citizens as possible.

Use **double quotation marks** for quotations within quotes.

## Spaces

- Colons, semi-colons and slashes are always joined up to the preceding word
- Stops (. ? ! : , ; ) are always followed by a single space, not a double space

## Bullet Points

See Formatting guidelines.

# Structuring Page Content

There are certain guidelines to follow when structuring page content. On this page, you will find more information about the page setup, SEO, and translation recommendations.

## Self-Contained Pages

Users may find your page through a search engine or by clicking a link on a different website. Each page needs to make sense as a free-standing unit. It should not rely on the context provided by navigating through the site's architecture.

Make sure the following page elements are clear and descriptive enough for every page. This ensures it will make sense on its own, without any additional context:

- Title
- Description/introduction (page banner)
- Headings

Bear in mind that users will often arrive at the page via a search engine or a link from elsewhere. They won't have the context provided by navigating through our site to help them. Users should not need to navigate back or forward in the architecture to understand what the page is about.

## Main Points First

What is the top task(s) your readers are visiting this page for? Make sure that you put these at the top of the page. Don't make your reader hunt for the information they want by burying it lower down the page.

## SEO Recommendations

### Production (Creating a New Page)

One of the most important website features evaluated by search engines is content. Presenting well-written and well-organised content to the users is vital to the success of a webpage. As a rule of thumb, if the content is relevant for human users, it will also be relevant for search engines.

Once you have considered the above points, you should follow these three steps to optimise your page content for search engines.

When building your page structure, be sure to:

- Pick a meaningful title, preferably shorter than 60 characters
- Insert a meta description for the page which:
  - If appropriate, contains a call to action (what can you do with that page, e.g. 'learn' about the EU, 'contribute' to law creation)
  - Matches the page content
  - Contains the focus keyword
  - Is no longer than 160 characters
- Write the text in a clear way with concise sentences relating to each other:
  - Avoid over-long sentences or too many commas
  - Avoid jargon or overly bureaucratic language
- Divide the page into a hierarchy of content sections. Give each of these sections a title using the headings (h2 to h4). Remember: headings create a hierarchy (e.g. h2 followed by h3 means that h3 is a subsection of h2). The hierarchy needs to be respected to avoid orphaned subheadings (e.g. h2 followed by h4 is wrong. h3 is always the subsection of h2 and h4 is a subsection of h3. Therefore, h4 can only be used as an h3 subsection)
  - Ideally write at least 1000-2500 words per page
  - If you have less, consider integrating the content with the parent or child page
  - If you have more, consider breaking down the content into other pages
- Start the sentences with the most relevant information (e.g. 'On 22 May I did this' => 'I did this on 22 May')
- Place any call to action buttons at the top of the page, so that users can see them immediately. Don't place call to action buttons at the end of the page
- Use culturally specific references if you are writing for a specific region or country
- Use meaningful text for links which explain what the linked page is about (especially if it's an internal page)
- Don't rely uniquely on images to convey concepts:
  - If you have an image with a graph, include a caption which explains exactly what is in the image. Ensure that the content around the image is somehow related to it
  - Don't forget to insert proper alternative text attributes

### Correction (Revamping an Existing Page)

When you are revamping an existing page:

- Remove unclear phrasing
- Check that keywords are used on the page
- Ensure that the first sentence of each paragraph conveys the sense of the whole paragraph
- Ensure that the page you created fits in the overall structure. Consider hierarchical constraints. Verify that the page is still reachable from the main landing page (i.e. don't create orphaned pages)
- Check HTML markup:
  - Prefer <em> or <strong> over <i> or <b>, as they have a semantic meaning and work better with screen readers and are therefore better for accessibility
  - Use semantic markup (header, nav, section, article, figure, footer)
  - Add title attribute on links
  - Ensure that there are no broken links on the website, especially if the link is internal

### Translation and Localisation

When it comes to page translation:

- Always translate cultural references
- Link only to social media in the local language
- Translate hidden parts of content (title tags, descriptions, alternative text)
- If possible, translate file names

## Optimising Content for AI

In recent years, the growing use of AI tools has reduced website traffic by an estimated 7–13%. To address this, we need to complement our SEO strategy with AEO (Answer Engine Optimisation), which makes our content easier to find and use by AI systems.

The most effective AEO approach today is to structure our content around question clusters, reflecting how people (and AI) search for information. Each sub-question should be marked with semantic HTML headings (<h2>, <h3>) and followed by a short, direct answer. This will help AI engines extract relevant information efficiently. Supporting each cluster with internal links, related topics, and structured data further enhances crawlability and context recognition (same SEO rules apply).

For example, instead of focusing on a single keyword per page, we should structure the content to answer a main question (e.g. 'How does renewable energy work?'), followed by a cluster of related sub-questions ('What are the types of renewable energy?', 'Is solar energy efficient?', 'What are the pros and cons of wind power?'). This reflects how modern AI systems, such as Google's Search Generative Experience (SGE) or ChatGPT, gather and present information.

# Style Guide

## Acronyms

In most cases, write out the long form the first time it is used on the page, followed by the acronym in brackets. After that, use the acronym.

In some cases it can be acceptable to use the short form only, if it is:

- More common than the long form (hint: if you have to stop to think what the long form actually stands for, it's probably okay to use the short form)
- Very widely known to and entered into search engines by the general public (NATO, for example)

When in doubt, write it out.

## Active and Passive Voice

In most cases, use the active voice so that the reader knows who is taking the action.

**Instead of:** Complaints can be submitted to the Commission in writing.

**Write:** You can submit a complaint to the Commission in writing. or You can complain to the Commission in writing.

On the other hand, the passive voice can be useful to avoid mentioning the actor, for example if this information is politically sensitive or irrelevant.

## Addresses

### General

In most cases, write out postal addresses as follows:

**Name of building**

**Street name and number**

**Town (with post code, if known)**

**Country**

**Example:**

Tabačka Kulturfabrik

Gorkého 2

Košice

Slovakia

### Bilingual Addresses

For addresses in Brussels, Belgium, provide the street name in French and Dutch, separated by a forward slash.

**Example:**

Berlaymont Building

Rue de la Loi/Wetstraat 200

1049 Brussels

Belgium

### Exceptions

On the European Commission website, postal addresses of Commission departments must never include a street name and use the generic postal address of the Commission instead.

**Example:**

Infrastructure and Logistics in Brussels

European Commission

1049 Brussels

Belgium

If applicable, you may include the street name in postal addresses of Commission executive agencies.

**Example:**

Research Executive Agency

Place Rogier 16

1049 Brussels

Belgium

## British English

Follow British English spelling conventions, but avoid colloquial terms and expressions that will be familiar only to native English speakers.

## Contractions

Use contractions: don't, can't, they've, we'll – unless you want to emphasise the contracted word (not, have, will).

## Conversational Tone

Writing on the web is more conversational than the administrative style used in typical Commission writing - it makes your content more accessible and easier to understand.

Use language that your audience uses, rather than what your colleagues in the European Commission probably use.

**If your audience is people looking for jobs in other EU countries:**
- Use terms like: jobs abroad, live and work in another EU country
- Instead of: free movement/circulation of labour

**If your audience is companies wanting to do business with the Commission:**
- Use terms like: tenders or contracts
- Instead of: public procurement

## Duplication

Make sure that the user need your writing is meant to meet is not already covered somewhere else on the European Commission's web presence. Search for the subject on the site or ask a policy expert. If relevant content exists elsewhere, link to it, don't duplicate.

## FAQs – Frequently Asked Questions

FAQs are poor web writing practice because:

- They make information harder to find, by bringing together unrelated points - content is easier to understand in context
- They're hard to scan quickly, because the term(s) users are looking for usually appears at the end of the question
- FAQs are generally not questions that users actually ask, but information that the organisation imagines that people want to know about its work
- They often duplicate other content on the site

If you take the time to understand your users' needs, and plan and write your content accordingly, it will answer their questions that are genuinely frequently asked.

## Gender-Neutral Language

Use gender-inclusive language that does not refer to the gender of the person where this is not relevant.

**Don't say:** Policeman, Air steward/ess

**Do say:** Police officer, Flight attendant

Do not use the male pronoun to refer to a generic individual, but also avoid he or she and (s)he. You can do this by:

- Addressing the user directly as you
- Using plural nouns
- Using they, them, their to refer to an individual. This is perfectly acceptable in standard English today.

**Don't say:** If a user wants to change his password, he should contact the administrator.

**Do say:** If you want to change your password, contact the administrator. or If users want to change their password, they should contact the administrator. or If a user wants to change their password, they should contact the administrator.

## Numbers

Write out numbers one to nine in words. Use numerals for 10 and above.

**Examples:**
- Five people attended the meeting
- 15 people attended the meeting
- The project received 25 applications

Use numerals for:
- Percentages: 5%, 25%
- Measurements: 3 km, 10 kg
- Money: €5, €25
- Ages: 5 years old, 25 years old
- Times: 5 pm, 3:30 am

## Plain Language

### Avoid Unnecessary Words

Remove words that don't add meaning to your text.

**Don't say:** It is important to note that the Commission has decided to implement a new policy.

**Do say:** The Commission has decided to implement a new policy.

### Avoid Redundancy

Don't repeat the same information in different ways.

**Don't say:** Dialogue between cultures is a necessary pre-condition for bringing the people closer. The mass media can play an important role in the reciprocal recognition and understanding of cultures as a source of mutual enrichment.

**Do say:** Dialogue between cultures brings people closer.

### Irrelevant Information

Focus on what readers need to know now, not historical details.

**Don't say:** When the "European Economic Area Treaty" (EEA Treaty) came into force on 1st January 1994, and Austria joined the European Union (EU) on 1st January 1995, secondary EC law also took effect in the area of social security (included in this are, in particular, Regulations 1408/71 and 574/72 relative to social security provision for migrant workers).

**Do say:** Social security in Austria is now also covered by EU law (in particular regulations 1408/71 and 574/72 on social security provision for migrant workers). "Now" is what interests readers - not intricate historical details.

## Upper or Lower Case

See upper or lower case guidelines.

## Verbs, Not Nouns

Many nouns ending in -ion are simply verbs in disguise. Ask yourself if there is a verb that could replace your noun phrase.

**Instead of:** carry out an evaluation of, give consideration to, since the accession of Poland to the EU

**Write:** evaluate, consider, since Poland joined the EU

## Writing Good Titles

### Guidelines

It is important to keep the title tag under 60-65 characters. This recommendation is based on user experience and SEO.

### Examples

**Title:** EUROPEAN COMMISSION | POLICIES, INFORMATION AND SERVICES

**Improvement:** POLICIES, INFORMATION AND SERVICES | EUROPEAN COMMISSION

**Title:** ABOUT THE EUROPEAN UNION | EUROPEAN COMMISSION

**Improvement:** Technically fine, but it fails to show that you are in the Information part of the website. Given that the context is clear, consider deleting the references to European: ABOUT THE UNION - INFORMATION SERVICES | EUROPEAN COMMISSION

**Title:** STRATEGY | EUROPEAN COMMISSION

**Improvement:** It is not clear from the title which strategy is being talked about. Better: STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN OF THE EUROPEAN UNION | EUROPEAN COMMISSION

**Title:** BETTER REGULATION: WHY AND HOW | EUROPEAN COMMISSION

**Improvement:** "why", "and" and "how" are stopwords, their use should be avoided in titles. Better: BETTER REGULATION IN THE EUROPEAN UNION | EUROPEAN COMMISSION

**Title:** FIND A PARTNER | EUROPEAN COMMISSION

**Improvement:** Better: FIND A PROJECT OR FINANCIAL PARTNER | EUROPEAN COMMISSION

**Title:** DIRECTORATE-GENERAL FOR AGRICULTURE AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT | EUROPEAN COMMISSION

**Improvement:** With this as the h1 heading, the page should be a page about DG AGRI itself. It's not. It's a page of Planning and Management documents related to DG AGRI. Better titles would be:
- Management Plans and Activity reports for DG AGRI
- Management Plans and Activity reports for Directorate-General for Agriculture and Rural Development
- DG AGRI Documents
- Directorate-General for Agriculture and Rural Development Documents

## Writing Good Meta Descriptions

### Guidelines

**Describe actions:** Identify the kind of actions that the visitor might want to achieve by visiting your page and find the closest verb that expresses that action (e.g. "learn", "consult", "discover")

**Provide a solution or benefit that the page offers:** Tell the searchers what they can expect by visiting the page. Make it clear that there is a real benefit to clicking through and reading your page and that they will be served with clear, informative and valuable content.

**Keep the description under 155 characters:** Search engines don't usually trim by characters but by pixel length. This means that a description made of iiiii will be allowed more characters than one made of ooooo.

**Don't deceive searchers:** If your meta description deceives the reader with content not relevant to what they expect, they will hit the back button as soon as they reach the page. This will increase the bounce rate and give Google a signal that your page is not relevant for the search terms.

**Make it specific and relevant:** Humans are good at recognising a predictable, generic meta description when they see it in the SERPs. That's why it is important to connect with your target audience and let them know they'll find specific information they couldn't get anywhere else.

# Upper or Lower Case

## General

The basic rule is that proper nouns have an initial capital but common nouns do not. Initial capitals are often employed to excess in commercial and administrative circles, but they can be visually distracting and are often unnecessary, so should be used sparingly. When in doubt, use lower case.

## Proper Names and Titles

Use initial capitals for proper nouns:

**Mr Goldsmith is a baker but Mr Baker is a goldsmith**

**Sir Francis Drake**

**the Archbishop of Canterbury**

**Dame Judi Dench**

**honourable Member (of the European Parliament)**

## Programmes, Policies, Agendas, Strategies, Action Plans, Frameworks, etc.

Should be in lower case:

**the programme on research and development in advanced communications technologies in Europe**

**Europe 2020 strategy**

**common agricultural policy**

**EU action plan on urban mobility**

## Acronyms/Initialisms

The existence of an acronym or initialism does not mean that initial capitals must be used when the corresponding expression is written out in full:

**non-governmental organisation (NGO)**

but

**European Central Bank (ECB)** (as this is the official name of the institution)

## Titles of Organisations, Institutions, Departments, Sections, Office Holders, Functions, Committees, Delegations, etc.

Use initial capitals on all nouns and adjectives when referring to the name in full.

**Publications and Dissemination Directorate**

**Business Development and Support Unit**

**Editorial Partnerships Section**

**Future Policies Working Group**

**President of the Council**

**Director-General for Agriculture**

**Council of Europe**

**European Development Fund**

**Markets in Crop Products Directorate**

**President of the French Republic**

**Vice-Chair of the Committee on International Relations** (but refer back to the chair, the vice-chair of the committee)

Use capitals for a particular institution or person, but small letters for groups of institutions or people. Exception: references to permanent EU bodies/formations (e.g. 'College of Commissioners', 'Directorates-General', 'Cabinets') and to official functions within the EU institutions (e.g. 'Members of the Commission', 'Directors-General') always take a capital letter, whether in the singular or the plural.

Ad hoc groups (e.g. the Polish delegation to a meeting) do not require the use of capitals.

For long names that read more like a description than a real title use an initial capital for the head word and lower case for the rest:

**Committee for the adaptation to technical progress of the directive on the introduction of recording equipment in road transport (tachograph)**

**Joint FAO/EU working party on forest and forest product statistics**

Names of institutions reproduced in a foreign language should retain the capitalisation of the original language, e.g. Banque centrale du Luxembourg. If you translate the name directly, then English capitalisation rules apply, e.g. the Central bank of Luxembourg.

## References to EU Legislation

Always write Regulation, Decision, Directive, Annex and Article (followed by a number) with capitals if they refer to specific acts:

**On 14 March 2018, the European Parliament and the Council adopted Directive (EU) 2018/10.**

**The competences of the European Union are defined in Articles 2 to 6 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).**

Use lower case for references to regulations, directives, etc. in a generalised sense and when referring to proposed legislation (i.e. draft regulation, a possible new directive on ...):

**The European Commission monitors the implementation of EU directives.**

**Several organisations have asked the Commission to propose a new regulation on artificial intelligence.**

## Full Names of International Agreements, Conferences, Conventions, etc.

Nouns and adjectives have an initial capital when using the full name:

**International Coffee Agreement**

**Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe**

**General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade**

but use lower case when referring back to the agreement, the conference, etc.

## Publications

Titles of books, journals, newspapers and periodicals normally take a capital on each word except articles, prepositions and conjunctions, and when cited are written in italics:

_New York Times_

_Cambridge Journal of Economics_

_European Economy_

_PM2 Project Management Methodology Guide_

_Commission Style Guide_

However, for long titles and subtitles use a capital only on the first word, on any proper nouns and on any adjectives formed from proper nouns:

**Economic and budgetary outlook for the European Union 2017**

**Handbook on European law relating to asylum, borders and immigration**

Likewise, titles of papers included in journals or as chapters in books, along with newspaper articles, take a capital only on the first word, on any proper nouns and on any adjectives formed from proper nouns. They are written in roman type in quotation marks.

## Periods, Events, Festivals, Seasons

Use initial capitals for periods such as:

**Second World War**

**Dark Ages**

and events such as:

**International Year of the Child**

**European Job Day**

**Second UN Development Decade**

**Edinburgh Festival**

Use capitals for days of the week, months and feast days:

**Tuesday, August, Ascension Day, pre-Christmas business**

Do not use capitals, however, for the 2018/2019 marketing year, the 2019 budget year, and so on.

Do not use capitals for spring, summer, autumn or winter.

## Graphics, Tables and Cross References

Figure (Fig.), Number (No), Volume (Vol.), Part, Chapter (Chap.), Section (Sect.), Article (Art.) should always have an initial capital when followed by a numeral; conversely, paragraph, point and line should not be capitalised.

The abbreviations shown here should be spelt out in running text:

**see page 250**

**as shown in Figure 5**

**refer to footnote 6**

**see also the following chapter/section**

## Party Denominations and Organisations

Use capitals for their names:

**Socialist Group, Fianna Fail Party**

but

**liberal, socialist, etc.**

## State or State?

Generally use lower case, e.g.:

**state-owned**

**reasons of state**

**nation states**

**the Arab states**

except in an abstract or legal sense, e.g.:

**the separation of Church and State**

and in the following instances, which are rooted in the Treaties:

**Member States** (when referring to EU Member States)

**State aid**

**Heads of State or Government** (when referring to the heads of state or government of all of the Member States as a group)

## Geographical Names and Political Divisions

Use initial capitals for proper nouns:

**North Pole**

**River Plate**

**Trafalgar Square**

**Third World**

**North Rhine-Westphalia**

**Northern Ireland**

**East Midlands**

**the North-West Frontier**

but lower case when describing a geographical area:

**northern England**

**western, central and eastern Europe**

**central European countries**

**Industry is concentrated in the north of the country.**

NUTS (Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics) region names do not follow these rules as they refer to the name of the authority for each region.

The South East is an administrative region of England, but do not use capitals in the general expression 'Rain is forecast for London and the south-east'.

Adjectival forms of points of the compass are not capitalised unless they form part of a proper name, e.g. an administrative or political unit or a distinct regional entity. Hence, southern Africa, northern France, eastern Europe but South Africa, Northern Ireland, East Indies. Noun forms are capitalised when they refer to geopolitical concepts (the West, the East) or geographical concepts (the North of England, the South of France), but not otherwise (the sun rises in the east and sets in the west). Compass bearings are abbreviated without a point (54° E).

Compound compass points follow the same rule and are hyphenated. Hence, south-eastern Europe but the North-West Passage, South-East Asia; they are always abbreviated as capitals without points (NW France).

## Proprietary Names and Generic Terms

Proprietary names (or trade names) are normally capitalised, for example:

**Airbus**

**Mercedes**

**Zara**

**Lego**

unless they have become generic terms, such as

**aspirin**

**gramophone**

**linoleum**

**nylon**

**celluloid**

Note:

**internet**

**the web**

## Botanical Works

The name of the genus appears with initial capitals, in italics (e.g. _Rosa, Felis_).

## Adjectives Derived from Proper Nouns

Not all adjectives derived from proper nouns take a capital:

**arabic (numerals)**

**french (chalk, polish, windows)**

**morocco (leather)**

**roman (type)**

## Hyphenated Constructions

Where constructions starting with one letter followed by a hyphen appear as a heading or at the beginning of a sentence, the letter preceding the hyphen should remain in lower case, e.g. 'e-Evidence' or 'o-Toluidine'.

# Web Writing Overview

## Introduction

Writing for the web is different from writing for print publications. Research has shown that people read online by scanning for information rather than reading the full text. They typically come to websites with a specific task in mind.

Consequently, it is important to present written content online in a way that is quick to scan, relevant, useful, consistent and easy to read.

The writing guidelines provided here should be referred to for web content production. By following the guidelines, you will help to ensure that the European Commission's digital content meets user needs. They also help the Commission meet its objective of communicating effectively with citizens.

## Official Writing Guides

For official documents, reports and printed publications, there are currently three recommended official writing guides available.

1. Interinstitutional Style Guide – mandatory rules for document production in any EU institution, body, office or agency. It includes detailed rules for acts published in the Official Journal and the main technical and editorial norms for general publications. Produced by the Publications Office.

2. European Commission style guide – mandatory rules for Commission staff drafting documents in English. It provides tips on clear writing, how to refer to official and non-official sources, and templates for standard Commission documents. Produced by the Secretariat-General.

3. English Style Guide – a deeper level of advice on style and grammar points (aligned with and expanding on much of the content of the other two guides). Aimed at in-house translators and freelance translators, it is also useful for authors and editors as well as translators in all EU institutions.

DG Translation produces a weekly newsletter providing tips on how to write clearly.

## Guiding Principles

Whenever you create content for the Commission's online presence, bear in mind that it should be:

- **Consistent** – recognisable as coming from a single authoritative source
- **Relevant and useful** – focused on user needs
- **Usable** – quick to scan, understand and act on
- **Accessible** – easy to read and interact with (particularly with regard to people with disabilities, e.g. alternative text for images)

Make sure to take into account that your content:

- Should be as easy as possible to translate into other languages
- Should be as accessible as possible and easily readable on mobile devices
- Is often written by and for non-native speakers of English

See this guide's Accessibility section for tips on how to make your content as accessible as possible.

For other information on how to optimise websites for search engines, see our recommendations about structuring page content.

To ensure your content complies with all these principles, contact DGT's Editing unit.

## Focus on User Needs

### Always Focus on the User Task

Before writing anything, answer these questions:

- Who is your target audience?
- What do they want to do on your web page?

You will have business goals in writing your text, but these must map onto some feasible need or interest of your target audience. All content should meet at least 1 pre-identified user need.

Your text should be useful and usable – not simply information in a void. What do you want your audience to do, having read your text?

### How to Write User-Focused Web Text

- Try to imagine which questions users would have in their mind on coming to your page (prompt yourself with the typical question words: who, why, what, how, when, etc.)
- List these questions – in the order your users need the information
- This can be the outline for your page structure. Each question could be a separate subheading, and the solution you are offering would be the text in that section
- Go straight to the point - put key information prominently at the top of the page. Don't bury it in long explanations or the history of the European Commission's work
- If you do need to give some background to the key information, this usually belongs lower down the page. Users will find it easily, if you make good use of headings and in-page navigation
- Don't leave users hanging when there is a next step – give them an option to find more information, make an enquiry – whatever helps them on their way.
