# Dates, Numbers and Symbols

## Dates

- Write the day as a number and the month in letters - e.g. 12 May
- Use all 4 digits for the year - e.g. 2020 (not '20)
- Don't use commas - e.g. 14 July 1999 (not 14 July, 1999)
- Don't use 'the' before the date. Don't use letters (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th)
- **Example:** on 9 October 2019 (not "on the 9th of October 2019")

## Date Ranges

Separate dates with either prepositions or dashes but don't mix them.

- from 1990 to 1995, **not** from 1990- 95
- between 1990 and 1995, **not** between 1990 - 95
- the 2007-08 report is available online

For date ranges where you indicate the year only, use a short dash with no spaces.

- 1996 - 2006

If the years are in the same century, don't repeat the century.

- 1939- 45

For date ranges where you indicate more than just the year, use a short dash with a space on either side of the dash.

- 2 - 5 March 2014
- 25 December 2011 - 30 January 2012

## Time

- Use the 24 hour clock
- Include the time zone (only once per date range)
- Separate hours and minutes with a colon
  - 09:00 (CET)
  - 23:59 (EST)
  - 17 March 2019, 09:00 - 18 March 2019, 18:00 (CET)

## Numbers

In most cases don't write numbers out, use numerals (1, 2, 3) which are easier to read onscreen.

However, avoid 2 numerals next to each other: 8 one‑day sessions, not 8 1-day sessions.

## Decimals

In English, Irish and Maltese, a point is used to separate whole numbers from decimals:

- 9.7 billion people
- 2.3 million light years

A comma is used for the same purpose in all other languages and in multilingual texts:

- 9,7 milliards
- 2,3 millions d'années lumière

## Thousands

A 'non-breaking' space is used to indicate thousands in whole numbers (not a comma). Decimals are grouped in a single block:

- 152 231.324567

## Fractions

Avoid using fractions. Decimals are easier to read and understand onscreen.

- Duration of visit: 2.5 hours (NOT 2½ hours)

## Numbers Greater Than 1 Million

For readability, use the words million, billion and trillion rather than a series of 000's:

- The Commission has committed €2.5 billion to the initiative
- The world economy has grown 470.1 trillion % since 2001

Billion means a thousand million (not a million million). Trillion means a million million.

In general do not abbreviate million and billion. However to avoid excessive repetition (for example in tables) they can be abbreviated to 'm' and 'bn' respectively. Use a space after the digits.

**Example table:**

| Country | Deficit (€) |
|---------|-------------|
| Country A | 10 m |
| Country B | 15 bn |

## Recommendations for Rounding Large Numbers

- If we don't need the highest level of accuracy, we can use rounding e.g. €60 million dedicated to language training for migrants, not €60,250,005 dedicated…
- Use only the number of digits that are necessary and make sense for clear communication
- A disclaimer should be added, when applicable, at the beginning or end of the publication describing the rounding policy and the reasons for possible inconsistencies - e.g. Figures have been rounded to one decimal place for the sake of brevity

## Telephone Numbers

Write the full number including the international code. Use + instead of 00. Separate the regional prefix from the main number.

If the number does not send the caller to a specific department within the European Commission, add Commission switchboard in brackets.

**Example:**

+32 2 299 11 11 (Commission switchboard)

## Symbols

Do not use spaces between symbols and figures.

Avoid using the ampersand (&) - use 'and' instead.

Use the following symbols:

- Currency symbols: €150 (EUR, GBP can also be used but the symbol is better)
- Percentage: 5%
- Temperature: 37°C

Do not use a space between the numbers and the symbol.
